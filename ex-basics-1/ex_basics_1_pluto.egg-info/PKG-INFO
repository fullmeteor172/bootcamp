2.  Create a virtual environment `uv venv` and source it.
3.  Start your IDE in this environment
4.  Setup your IDE to use the virtual environment you setup.
5.  Create a module called `<yourname>-hello` in that folder.
6.  Write the code that says hello to the argument passed or world, by default.
7.  Publish the module in [TestPyPI for Package Testing](https://test.pypi.org/).

In your readme, please provide the link to the package. Also, do the readme.md well enough so that the package page looks good.

### Solution:
1. **Initialized the project and setup the** `.toml`
